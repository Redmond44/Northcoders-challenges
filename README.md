# Northcoders Katas

## Coding problems to solve
All solutions are written in Javascript with Node.js.

Solving katas required operations on arrays, objects, strings and nested arrays/objects as well as regular expressions, recursion, working with ASCII code and hexadecimal numerical system. Additionally used Underscore and md5-hash (`crypto` module).

For testing used Mocha and Chai and Supertest for testing asynchronous functions.
